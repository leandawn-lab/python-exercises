# A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
# example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls
# it twice:
#   def do_twice(f):
#       f()
#       f()
# Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice:
#   def print_spam():
#       print('spam')
#       do_twice(print_spam)
# 1. Type this example into a script and test it.
# 2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value,
# and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
# 3. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
# 4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam'
# as an argument.
# 5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and
# calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be
# only two statements in the body of this function, not four.

def do_twice(f, value = 2):
      valueIndex = 1
      while valueIndex <= value:
          print(f)
          valueIndex += 1


def print_spam():
       do_twice('spam', 2)


def do_four():
    do_twice('spam', 2)
    do_twice('spam', 2)
# print_spam()
do_four()
